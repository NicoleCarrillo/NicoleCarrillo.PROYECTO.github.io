            We are having our interview this Thursday through Skype.</p>
    <p>Our expert is a member of the association Ocean Cleanup, Noah Johnson. We think he’s indeed a perfect person to interview because he is in the middle of the problem solution and we’re working towards the same goal though we are seeing it from a different perspective.</p>
    <p> Our user could be anyone who’s aware of the problem of pollution in the Pacific Ocean, we’re mainly targeting young people in order to create more awareness and knowledge about this big issue in our oceans.</p>

          <p> I think this partial we worked really hard and we deserve 100 because we have been doing a great job, we considered a lot of principles and laws in order to get better solutions to our problems, and also, we worked really well as a team.</p>
          <p>Luis: </p>
            <p>I think we deserve a 100 in our partial grades because we did some good work, our project is going to the right direction and we have been thinking a lot about the different aspects we should consider, so we can end with great results.</p>
      <p>Roberto:</p>
       <p>I think we have been working hard so we deserve to get a good grade, like 100, this time I think we were more organized than last partial, so we ended up with better results, we should keep doing things as right now, so we can finish with a great project and lots of knowledge.</p>
