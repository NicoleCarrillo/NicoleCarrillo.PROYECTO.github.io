Eighty percent of marine pollution comes from land. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off pesticides or dirt into the ocean. Land and air pollution have proven to be harmful to marine life and its habitats.

      <p>There are two main types of plastics in the oceans and in the garbage islands: the macroplastics and the microplastics. The first ones consist mainly of containers, bags, boxes, lenses and in general complete objects; while the microplastics are those that are derived from the macroplastics, that is to say, they are the small pieces (2 to 5 mm) that sometimes get to get rid of a container.</p>

      <p>The big island formed in the Pacific Ocean contains microplastics in general; When the existence of this island was discovered, it was thought that it was only formed by this type of plastic, however, now it exists equally and in an impressive way, macroplastic. This worries experts because over time, these macroplastics can be transformed into microplastics, which makes it much harder to collect.

<p>The scientist of the Institute of Marine Sciences and Limnology of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), Alfonso Vázquez Botello, explained that due to the adverse impacts on health, ecology and economy generated by toxic substances in plastic, this is considers a global threat.He pointed out that 200 million tons of plastic are currently produced, being China, the European Union and the United States the main producing countries. Latinoamerica with 5% of the total plastic produced on a global scale. “As we do not know what to do with plastics, we do bad management and eight million tons of plastics end up in the oceans every year, "he said in his presentation at the Cicese. </p>
